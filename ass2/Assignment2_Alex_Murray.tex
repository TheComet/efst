\title{Inglorious Basterds -- Tavern Scene}
\author{Alex Murray}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In  this  report,  we  will  be  looking  at  the  tavern scene in  the  movie
\textit{Inglorious    Basterds}.    The    scene    can    be     found     on
youtube\cite{ref:scene}.

\begin{threeparttable}
    \begin{tabular}{p{6.8cm}p{8.2cm}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Story}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What story does the film tell?
    \item What happened before this scene?
    \item What will happen after this scene?
\end{itemize} &
It's about a group of  American  soldiers, known as \textit{The Basterds}, who
spread  fear  among  the   German  soldiers  by  killing  and  scalping  them.
\textit{The Basterds} soon  learn  about  a premiere of a Nazi propaganda film
which  is  to  be  played  to  an  audience of Nazi leaders, including  Joseph
Goebbels and Adolf Hitler. They plan to attack the cinema during the premiere.

Hicox  (British  Royal  Marine  Lieutenant)  and  some  members of \textit{The
Basterds} go to the tavern to meet with an  undercover  agent, the German film
star Bridget von Hammersmark. to plan the attack on  the  cinema.  Hicox draws
the attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Gestapo Major Dieter Hellstrom
with his unusual accent.  He  gives  himself away by ordering three drinks and
gesturing  ``three''  with  his hand  (with  thumb  and  pinky  finger  down);
Hellstrom  knows  that  Germans  gesture ``tree'' with the thumb and first two
fingers extended.  Discovered,  Stiglitz  and  the Basterds open fire, killing
everyone  in  the  tavern except Sergeant  Wilhelm  and  Hammersmark,  who  is
wounded.

\midrule
\textbf{Setting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where does the action take place?
    \item How quickly can we establish where the story takes place?
    \item Does the setting lead to certain expectations?
\end{itemize} &
The scene takes place in a tavern  in Germany. We can fairly quickly establish
that the tavern is located in Germany,  because a Nazi walks in and decides to
join  in  on  the  discussion. The setting is calm, but a lot of tension comes
from how they interact with the Nazi.

\midrule
\textbf{Sound}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there any music?
    \item Does the music create atmosphere?
    \item How do the characters speak?
\end{itemize} &
There  is  no  music.  There  is  nothing out of the  ordinary  with  how  the
characters speak. 
\\

\midrule
\textbf{Characters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What do we learn about the characters through what they say?
    \item What do we learn about the characters through what they do?
    \item What do we learn about the characters through visual clues?
\end{itemize} &
We  learn  that the Nazi, Wilhelm, is in full support of the German Reich  and
would rather sacrifice himself to kill a few English  than  walk  out  of  the
tavern and live with himself.

Both Hicox and Wilhelm are extremely cautious with the way they speak. You can
feel a strong sense of distrust.

\midrule
\textbf{Colour}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What colours are used in the scene?
    \item Are the colours warm or cold?
    \item How do the colours make you feel?
\end{itemize} &
The scene is glowing warm, it feels cozy.
\\

\midrule
\textbf{Camera}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Note down any close-up, medium and wide shots in the scene. Why were these shots used?
    \item If there are any close-up shots, what emotions do they represent?
    \item Can you think of adjectives or phrases to describe these emotions?
\end{itemize} &
The shots are almost exclusively taken from behind the person being talked to,
over the shoulder. There are close-up  shots of when Wilhelm cocks his pistol,
and  another  when  one of \textit{The Basterds} holds his  gun  to  Wilhelm's
balls.

I wouldn't say there's anything special with the way this  scene  is shot, and
thus, don't have much to comment as far as emotions go.
